Created a worldAR effect using PlaneTracker in sparkAR. 

During the first week of September, I along with Rohan Panth participated in Facebook Hackathon : AR.

The task was to create a World AR Effect using spark AR.

We were successful in submitting an Instagram Reel effect of a game demonstrating plane tracker feature.
And our filter was among the eligible submissions after being judged :)

The official documentation of spark AR and tutorials helped a lot in understanding the features like Plan Tracking, Segmentation, Face Tracker, etc.

A big thanks to Facebook and Devpost for such a wonderful experience in the hackathon.

### How to use the effect?
Open the link on Instagram in back camera mode (worldAR). Tap on the monsters to kill or make them invisible before the timer runs out.
